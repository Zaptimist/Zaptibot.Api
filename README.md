# Zaptibot Project

This project is a demonstration of my coding skills and knowledge, created to showcase my abilities and allow others to review my work. After the review, I will maintain this project to develop a real API for my old Discord bot (personal project). This repository contains multiple projects, each with its own purpose and documentation.
